I once owned a [noun] who was [adjective]
only [xxx] when in a [car-brand] [xxx]] automobile.
Some [plural-noun] thought, [adverb], that this was [adjective],
but what did they [verb].
Anyway, now I am [comparative], and don't [verb] so much, even
when in [car-brand] cars.  Do you think that's [adjective], or
should I [take-a-flying-leap]?
