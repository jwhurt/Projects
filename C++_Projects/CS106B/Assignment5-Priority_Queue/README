Project Description
Assignment 5 from Stanford's CS106B Programming Abstractions, Winter 2015, Eric Roberts

Summary: In this assignment, you will have the chance to implement a collection class called a priority queue, 
	 which stores its elements in an order determined by a numeric priority value.
