How to run the programs in the Assignment3 folder

3-1-stairs.cpp
	g++ 3-1-stairs.cpp
	./a.out

The remaining programs need to be run using QtCreator.  The procedure is the same for each folder.
First save the folder.  Open QtCreator, then select File>Open File Or Project.  Navigate to the folder, and double click the .pro file.
QtCreator will open the project folder.  Hit the green arrow to run the program.
