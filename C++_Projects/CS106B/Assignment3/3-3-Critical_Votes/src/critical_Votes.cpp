/* Problem 3:  Counting Voting Block Critical Votes. 
 * A critical vote is one that changes the election outcome.
 * For this problem, you will count the number of situations in which a block's vote is critical.
 * Methodology: The voting system has N blocks. Take the target block and set it aside. Now consider the 
 * possible election outcomes using the remaining N-1 blocks. There are 2N-1 different possibilities; 
 * In each of those 2N-1 situations, consider adding in the target block's voteâ€” will its choice of 
 * candidate force the win for that candidate? If so, then it's a critical vote.
