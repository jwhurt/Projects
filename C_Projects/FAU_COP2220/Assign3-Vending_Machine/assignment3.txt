Intro to Programming in C
Programming Assignment 3				Due Wednesday, October 28th

AAA Vending Company needs to create software for their new line of snack vending machines. Each machine will contain the following items 
    P – Potato Chips	     $1.25
    S - Snickers Bar	     $1.35
    T – Pop Tart	     $0.95
    C – Cookies		     $1.50
    B – Brownie		     $1.75
    N – Nuts		     $1.40
 
•	You must have at least these 7 user defined functions:
o	void Menu(char *selection); // Displays the list of snack items and prompts for the user’s choice 
o	int CheckMoney(double *payment, double item_cost); //compares the amount the user has deposited to the price of item selected. It returns 1 if the amount is at least enough to cover the cost, 0 if there is not enough.
o	void GetMoney(double *payment, double item_cost, char selection);  //calls CoinMenu function to collect money from the user and CheckMoney function to keep comparing the deposited amount to the item cost. 
o	void GetChange(double *payment, double item_cost, double *change); //calculates the amount of change to be returned
o	void CoinMenu(double *payment );  //displays menu of coins and gets user input of the coins deposited
o	void Quit(char *again); //Asks the user if they want another snack.
o	void GetCost(char selection, double *item_cost); //sets the cost of the purchase based on value in selection

Additional Requirements:
•	   Create a typed algorithm that outlines the steps your program will follow in English/pseudocode. This is worth 10 points of the grade for this assignment.
•	   Use function prototypes.
•	   Write comments for each function that will appear in the file before each prototype and again before each function definition.
•	   Be sure to comment your code adequately.
•	   Be sure to indent properly. Check your textbook examples to see how it should be done.
•	   Use meaningful variable names.
•	   Electronically submit only your source code, Snacks.c through the Assignment Manager in Blackboard.
•	   Turn in an electronic copy of your source code by 9 am on Wednesday, October28th.
•	   Turn in a hard copy of your source code, a sample output demonstrating your program, and a copy of your algorithm in class on Wednesday, October 28th.
•	   Late Submission: No program will be accepted for grading after 8am on Monday, November 2nd. Late penalties apply.
